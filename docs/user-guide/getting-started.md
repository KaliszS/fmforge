# 🚀 Getting Started

## Installation

FM Forge is a cross-platform application available for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

1.  Download the latest release for your operating system from the [Releases page](../../releases).
2.  **macOS**: Drag the `.app` file to your Applications folder.
3.  **Windows**: Run the installer `.exe`.
4.  **Linux**: Run the `.AppImage` or install the `.deb` package.

## First Launch

When you first open FM Forge, you will be greeted by the main dashboard. The table will be empty until you load a file.

## Loading Data

1.  Click the **"Load File"** button in the top-left corner.
2.  Navigate to your Football Manager data folder (usually where you keep your `.edt` files).
3.  Select one or more `.edt` files.
    *   *Tip: You can select multiple files to merge them into a single view.*
4.  The application will parse the files and display the player records in the table.

### Mod Settings (Optional)
If you are working with a **Retro Database**, you might want to configure the date offsets:
1.  Click the **Settings** (gear icon) in the header.
2.  Enter the **FM Edition** (e.g., `24` for FM24).
3.  Enter the **Retro Year** (e.g., `2005` for the database year).
4.  Toggle **"Show Real Birth Dates"** to see birth years adjusted to the retro era.

## Saving Your Work

1.  Click the **"Save File"** button.
2.  Choose a location and filename.
3.  **Important**: You can choose to save **All Players** or only **Filtered Players**. This is useful if you want to extract a specific subset of players into a new file.
